# OgreStarterKit
No-brainer cross platform Ogre3D project creator.

The goal of this project is to get an OSX and Windows app that will download and create a new Ogre3D project for you, without you having to download and install all the libraries or mess with CMake configurations.  Kinda like how OpenFrameworks has a project creator.

If I can get a basic version of this working I plan on creating similar apps for Ogre Game Kit, again, to simplify the experience for any users.

This party is just getting started so hang tight.  Gonna get the basics working before it gets pretty.
